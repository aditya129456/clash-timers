# Changelog

All notable changes to this project are listed here. The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/), and versions follow [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/).

1.0.2 is the first version published on GitHub. Earlier versions were shared privately.

## [1.0.2] - 2026-11-03

### Fixed

- Fixed a crash at start-up on Android 10 that affected 1.0 and 1.0.1. It came from code optimization in the release build.

### Changed

- Release builds no longer use code shrinking or optimization, so the app runs reliably across phones and Android versions. The APK is larger as a result, about 9 MB instead of about 2 MB.

## 1.0.1 - 2026-11-03

### Added

- Crash reporting that stays on the phone: a crash screen, and a **Last crash** section in the app with Copy, Show and Clear.
- A notification that opens the crash screen when the app crashes in the background.

## 1.0 - 2026-11-03

First release.

### Added

- Home screen widget with builder, laboratory and pet house timers, live countdowns and progress bars.
- Sync from the game's village data export through the clipboard.
- Finish times that include Builder's Apprentice and Lab Assistant sessions, potions and Builder Bites.
- Support for the event Goblin Builder.
- Notifications when a builder, the lab or the pet house is free.
- Settings for boost strength, helper savings, helper interval and builder count.
